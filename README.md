For QA interviews - technical challenge

## Setup

### GitHub

Create a public repository on your GitHub account with the test contents.

### Backend

Follow the instructions in `backend/README.md`.

This also includes a `Quick example` section for faster setup.

Check `swagger` and `redoc` for endpoints.

### Frontend

Follow the instructions in `frontend/README.md`.

## Automated tests

### Backend

When all runs well, create automated tests (ideally in Behave, or Robot Framework) for all backend endpoints. Document the tests in a readme file.

### Frontend

Create automated e2e tests (ideally in Cypress, or Jest) for frontend UI covering as many features and case scenarios as necessary to validate the app. Remember that the app is responsive for mobile devices. Document the tests in a readme file.

### GitHub

Push all changes to the main branch of your repo and share it with us for evaluation.

Include as many commits as necessary with relevant comments.

There is no time restriction on the first to last comment or number of commits.

Good luck!
